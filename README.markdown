## DESCRIPTION:

View and edit GEDCOM files.

From Chris' page:
GenerationX is a genealogy tool designed specifically for weekend hobbyists. GenX is the first
application of its kind developed entirely in Cocoa and optimized for Mac OS X. Native compliance
with the GEDCOM 5.5 standard makes it simple to share data with other genealogy systems.
GenerationX has been praised by the hobbyist community and bundled with publications by
Family History Monthly Magazine.
